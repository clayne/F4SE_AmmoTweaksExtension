F4SE AmmoTweaks Extension
=========================


WIP plugin for AmmoTweaks v2.0 adding some weapon and ammo features.


Notes for compiling:

- The Plugin\src\AmmoTweaks folder needs to be with the F4SE source files to compile ((Fallout 4 directory)\src\)
- Made with Visual Studio 2015/2017 (should work with 2017, not sure about backwards compatibility with 2015)


- Uses SimpleINI (https://github.com/brofield/simpleini) for config file read operations
- Uses code based on xoroshiro128+ (http://xoshiro.di.unimi.it/xoroshiro128plus.c) for random number generation
